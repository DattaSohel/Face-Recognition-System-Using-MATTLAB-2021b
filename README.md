# Face-Recognition-System-Using-MATTLAB-2021b
This Project Is used to Recognize Face of People and Popular People

The Face Recognition project aims to develop a robust and accurate system for automatically identifying and verifying 
individuals based on their facial features using MATLAB 2021b. The project involves implementing various 
algorithms and techniques to detect, extract, and match facial characteristics. MATLAB 2021b serves as the primary 
software platform for developing the face recognition system. MATLAB offers a comprehensive set of images 
processing and computer vision functions that facilitate the processing and analysis of facial images. It provides tools 
for image preprocessing, feature extraction, pattern recognition, and machine learning.
